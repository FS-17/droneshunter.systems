## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Python is the primary programming language used to train the YOLOv5 model.
- **YOLOv5**: YOLOv5 is real-time object detection system that is used to detect drones in the airspace.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that is used to train the YOLOv5 model and convert it to a javascript model so that it can be used in the browser.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a front-end framework that is used to design the user interface of the DroneHunter Systems website.
